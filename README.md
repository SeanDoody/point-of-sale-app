Point of sale project using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
This was a group project option from Grand Circus' Front-End bootcamp. Since my group chose a different option, I built this app by myself for extra practice. All code is mine.
Three separate views for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
