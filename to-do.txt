HTML best practice improvements
    maintain header hierarchy (one h1, then h2, etc)
        in HTML
        in JS
    change item objects to forms? (select + button at least)
        button should be "form submit"
    change price elements to <data>?
    add <label>s for payment methods!

styling/CSS best practice improvements
    add breakpoint for iPad and laptop

disable form input on enter, make sure forms are set correctly
percent tip amount not working

stretch: expanded view
    show zoomed in view of picture, desc, etc.
    add ons/modifications (creamer, sugar, etc)
    "add to cart" button with dropdown for quantity
    if already in cart, allow to delete or edit quantity
    add "go to cart" button

validations
    payment
        card
            card number validation
                add spaces automatically
                add warning to tell user not to actually enter number!
            card expiration validation
                add slash automatically
            all    
                figure out way to prevent pushing out last character if inserting in middle of string?
                create common char limit function to call within other validation functions   
            form submission
                need to block user from proceeding
                    when card fields are not filled in correctly 
                    when cash is not sufficient
    cart
        when going to empty card, add message like "nothing in cart yet"
        do not allow user to proceed to checkout when cart is empty
